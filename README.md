# Todo application with Vanilla javascript
This challenge was to create a dynamic todo application only using Vanilla Javascript as part of a TeamTreehouse.com course. Before this Treehouse taught how to use jQuery to manipulate the DOM.
The aim of this course was to get students comfortable accessing and traversing the DOM when jQuery isn't really needed.
